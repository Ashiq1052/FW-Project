import math

# Example 1: Using math functions
print("The square root of 16 is:", math.sqrt(16))
print("Pi is:", math.pi)
print("Euler's number is:", math.e)
print("Cosine of pi is:", math.cos(math.pi))

# Example 2: Using math to solve real-world problems
# Calculate the area of a circle with a given radius
radius = 5
area = math.pi * math.pow(radius, 2)
print(f"The area of the circle is: {area:.2f}")

# Section 2: Datetime Module
# --------------------------
# The datetime module allows you to manipulate dates and times.

import datetime

# Example 3: Working with datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print("Current date and time:", now)
print("Year:", now.year)
print("Month:", now.month)
print("Day:", now.day)


# Example 4: Calculating differences in time
new_year = datetime.datetime(2024, 1, 1)
time_left_for_new_year = new_year - now
print("Days until new year:", time_left_for_new_year.days)

# Example 5: Formatting dates and times
formatted_date = now.strftime("%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S")
print("Formatted date and time:", formatted_date)

# Section 3: Practical Applications
# ---------------------------------
# Combining math and datetime for advanced calculations and data handling.

# Example 6: Calculating age in years
def calculate_age(birthdate):
    today = datetime.date.today()
    age = today.year - birthdate.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (birthdate.month, birthdate.day))
    return age

birthdate = datetime.date(1999, 6, 15)
age = calculate_age(birthdate)
print(f"Age is: {age} years")

# Assignments
# -----------
# Assignment 1: Write a function that calculates compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt).
# Assignment 2: Create a script that prints the current time and updates every second.

# Congratulations on completing the in-depth section on Python's math and datetime modules!
# Review the assignments, try to solve them, and check your understanding of these powerful tools.
